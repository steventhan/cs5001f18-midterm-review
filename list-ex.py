"""
1. Design a function to convert in-place any list to a list of integers. 
Non-numeric types are converted to 0, numeric types are converted to integers.

Example:
[1, 5.0, "str"] -> [1, 5, 0]
["s", 42, True] -> [0, 42, 0]
"""

"""
2. Design a function to merge two lists into one.

Example:
lst1 = [1, 5.0, "str"]
lst1 = ["s", 42, True]

After merging lst1 becomes [1, 5.0, "str", "s", 42, True]
Now, modify the function so that original lists remain the same, and the
function returns the merged list as new list.

"""
3. Design a function that flattens a 2D list.

Example:
Input: [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9]
"""

"""
4. Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus
one to the integer. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit
is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit. 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.

Example 2:
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.

5. Design a function that verifies a list of password. Try to see if you
can solve it using a recursive approach.

6. Design a function that gives a list of valid passwords. Try to see if you

"""
7. Design a function to find out if a list is monotonic. A list is monotonic 
if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: [6,5,4,4]
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: [1,2,4,5]
Output: true

Example 5:
Input: [1,1,1]
Output: true
